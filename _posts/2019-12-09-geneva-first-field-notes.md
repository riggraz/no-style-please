Dear all,

It's been a few months since I've arrived in Geneva. This is a fascinating place (though not without its challenges, of course), and I'm finally starting to feel settled. There's a lot to share, and that will take time to process, but I wanted to post a few photos of the past few months. I've been getting lots of mountain time, overdosing on politics, and studying up on just about everything. More on that later; but in a meantime, a few photos.

A view from my flat:

Walking back from the crag:

Young climate protests at the Global Climate Strike, which happened to be on the same day as the Free Tibet protests:

Fondue at one of my favorite places in Geneva (Bains des Pâquis):

Many, many forums: on climate justice, on human-centred design, on Brazil's politique, on jewel auctions, and everything in between...

Finally, a photo of beautiful Lake Geneva at dusk:

Full disclosure: I post more frequently on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anneleesteele/); but will be returning to longform and this blog soon. I may be posting the cycling stories I'd compiled from last summer here as well, for posterity's sake. Until soon.

Always,

A

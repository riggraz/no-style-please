_Note: Back in August of last year, I [wrote a blog]() that aimed to summarise some personal reflections about digital life, community management, and researcher/praxis reflections a year into my role with The Turing Way. As Jia Tolentino wrote in her book **Trick Mirror**: "I write to think", and for me, this is true as well. Journalistic or creative writing uses a very different set of muscles than documentation or academic writing, and as I kick off my second year with the project, I wanted to document these broader reflections._

# The growth of digital 'third spaces' 

It took me a long time to realise that as a Community Manager of an open source project, I'm a steward of a kind of "digital third space", which (and I'll explain later), I've started to call a fourth space. 

The "third space" is a term coined by American sociologist Ray Oldenburg, as spaces for gathering that play a different role than home (the first place) or work (the second place). For him, third spaces were "cafes, coffee shops, bookstores, bars, hair salons and other hangouts at the heart of a community" (_The Great Good Place_, 1999). In many ways, his book highlighted the importance of third spaces in a time when they seemed to be disappearing from American life, in favor of suburbanisation and the increasing privatisaton of public spaces.

These third spaces were important, because they created social bonds and connections outside of the context of working life, labor, and the nuclear family. I love how Lia Schifitto described them in the [syllabus project](https://syllabusproject.org/third-places/): 
> "In the most basic sense, a third place is somewhere people gather that is neither the home (first place) nor for labor (second place). There is a certain magic to third places. They subvert barriers and boundaries we often accept, expanding limitations we unknowingly perpetuate. Third places exist in the in-between, a space both liminal and seemingly permanent and tangible. _They are both the site of connection but also the connection itself._"

Many urban planners, designers, and sociologists have understood this implicitely and at length. Jane Jacobs talked about the importance of "sidewalks" in facilitating community connections in urban spaces. Of course, many cities across the world continue to have vibrant "third spaces", and it would be a grave mistake to universalise the idea that all third spaces are in decline. I'm thinking of city squares (*plazas*) in Spanish cities, or the X of coffee houses in Turkey. These spaces are very  

Third spaces haven taken many forms, and will continue to evolve as we do. They are coffee shops, community gardens, churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, co-ops, pubs, parks, clubs, music venues – even malls. 
## The rise of digital third spaces and open source 'communities'

From the get go, the internet operated as a kind of "third space" for many. It was an escape from the norms and values in life IRL ("in real life"), for better or for worse. Countless digital scholars have documented the cultures of digital life: from hacker communities, to forums, to dating apps and how they have affected our digital life.

The free and open source software movements similarly emerged from one of the world's most famous third spaces: that of the university. As hardware, software, and services unbundled in the breakdown of mainframe computers, it was at the university that early computer scientists were able to reimagine an understanding of software that went beyond intellectual property and copyright to something perhaps more.

In the years since, this way of working has expanded in scope and size. Open source communities have become vibrant ecosystems: X. They're also a critical infrastructure, as [this famous comic from xkcd defly illustrates](), and as Nadia Eghbal wrote about in her book *[Bridges and Roads]()*. As their important has become increasing visislbe, various funds to support their maintenance have emerged: from Mozilla's XXX, to Code for Science and Society's XXX, to the Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation's .
## How spaces changed during the COVID-19 pandemic

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our sense of spaces and the boundaries between them blended. For many, the COVID-19 pandemic was the first time that many jobs went online, along with most other services: from school

## Digital third spaces of open science and _The Turing Way_

When I joined _The Turing Way_, the team based at the Alan Turing Institute was expanding greatly. As a part of people's roles at the Turing, many were required to contribute to the project that I was a part of. 

That's not to say that fantastic friendships can't form from collaborations, but rather that the 

Open source has always blurred the line between the two. 

But what about digital "third spaces"?

## Learnings from facilitating third spaces

### 1. People generally tend to want different things from their second and third spaces 

If there's anything I've learned, it's that third spaces are often very different from first and second spaces – both in the norms and expectations of . 

For example: you probably wouldn't like your partner to interact with you in the same way that your line manager does, and you wouldn't expect them to as well. 

Faciliting a third space looks like facilitating spaces of belonging, joy, meaning, and subversion: people want something different. 

Facilitating a second space might look like: managing expectations and people, project management, professionalism, leadership, and efficiency. 

Of course, these expectation often blur. 

Last year, I spoke to my team about "professional love languages", 

I've also seen many friends burn out many times. As d

### 2. More than ever, movements tend to be built on the blurring of the first and second space

Let's face it, the boundaries between first and second spaces have never _really_ been clear. The role of the boy's club (both literally and metaphorically) has long been an example of this typeo of . Similarly, XXX. 

That's not to say that boundaries are universally to be either dispara

What happens when the social norms of the second space blur into the second? When professional life in the second space bleeds to where you spend our free time? 

For example: the type of facilitation you need in a professional meeting is not necessarily the same 

### 3. Because digital third spaces are usually moderated by people, what are the ?



## Questions 

As I consider

### 1. Where do the (digital) boundaries lie between digital second and third spaces now lie?

They have, of course been blurred for a while now. 

### 2. What is the responsibility of a digital third space in the attention economy – and the shifts in current political life?

One of my good friends is a political organiser. She 

### 3. What is the role of privatisation in the development of third spaces?

Over the past few years, I've studied, observed, and been in . 

This infrastructure of "public space" relates very closely to the notion of "knowledge commons" and "digita".
